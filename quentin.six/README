Welcome to Ekip.
First, to use our OCR, you need to go in folder named "Traitement-image". There you can type "make" in your terminal to compile.
Then you have two options.

The first one, to see all the steps of the image treatment and segmentation. To do so, type "./main *path to your image" --sdl". The image will open and you can press a key to go through the different steps.

The second options is to use the final project, just type "./main" in the console. The GUI opens with buttons on it:
- To select an image click on "open image", select it and then click on "load image".
- The "Train neural network" will train the neural network, if it doesn't exist the neural network is created before its training.
- The "Delete" button will delete the ".save" files (the neural network)
- The "Delete *.txt" button will delete the ".txt" files which correspond to each character of a selected image

- To finish, if an image is selected and loaded you can click on the Button "OCR" to launch the main function, it will create a file "output.txt" wich will contain the characters of the selected image.
